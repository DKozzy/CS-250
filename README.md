# CS-250

Welcome to the CS 250 repository! This repository contains a collection of projects I developed as part of my CS 250 course at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this course, I explored the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Agile methodologies, and best practices in software development. This repository showcases my ability to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## About the Course
CS 250 focuses on understanding and applying the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) from both a developer and tester perspective. The course covers various software development methodologies, documentation processes, and best practices for creating high-quality software in an Agile development environment. Topics explored in this course include:
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) – Understanding different phases and methodologies.
- Agile & Scrum – Working within Agile teams and applying Scrum practices.
- Software Testing – Writing and executing test cases to ensure software quality.
- User Stories & Requirements Gathering – Defining software features and project scope.
- Project Management Tools – Using tools like Jira or Trello for task management.

## What You'll Find Here
This repository contains the CS 250 Final Project, which focuses on applying Agile and Scrum principles in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). As part of this project, I took on the role of a Scrum Master for a simulated development team, guiding the transition from a traditional Waterfall model to an Agile methodology.

The key components of this project include:
- Sprint Review & Retrospective – Conducted a final sprint review and retrospective, analyzing the development process, team roles, and the impact of Agile on project outcomes.
- User Stories & Agile Artifacts – Developed and evaluated user stories, ensuring they aligned with customer requirements and business goals.
- Project Interruptions & Adaptability – Assessed how Agile allowed the team to handle interruptions and pivot based on changing requirements.
- Agile Communication & Collaboration – Demonstrated effective team communication and collaboration strategies in an Agile setting.
- Agile vs. Waterfall Presentation – Created a PowerPoint presentation for leadership, comparing the Waterfall and Agile approaches, highlighting the benefits of Scrum, and making recommendations for company-wide adoption.

## Why This Project Matters
The project in this repository was designed to strengthen my skills in:
- Applying the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in real-world scenarios.
- Writing and testing software to ensure quality and functionality.
- Using Agile methodologies to manage development and improve collaboration.
- Developing user-friendly and functional applications based on software requirements.

## Reflection
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in Agile development, software testing, and project management. I learned how to analyze software requirements, write test cases, and implement software solutions that meet industry standards. These skills will be invaluable as I continue to develop my expertise in software engineering.

## Future Applications
The skills I developed in CS 250 are highly transferable to various areas of software development and project management. Whether it's working in an Agile team, developing software using best practices, or ensuring software quality through testing, the knowledge gained in this course will serve as a strong foundation for future career opportunities.

Thank you for visiting this repository! I hope it provides a clear representation of my software development and testing skills.
